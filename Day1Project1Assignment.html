        <h1>FLOWERS</h1>
        <p>
            A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in 
            flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). 
            The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing 
            a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion 
            of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross pollination
            or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.

        <h2>ROSES</h2>
        <p>
            A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or 
            the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.
            They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that 
            are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and 
            showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, 
            with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.Species, cultivars 
            and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired 
            cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, 
            to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[citation needed] Different species hybridize 
            easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.
